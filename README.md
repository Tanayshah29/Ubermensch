# Ubermensch_IOT_Home-Automation-System
Home automation has been a challenge in the domain of Internet-of-Things (IoT) for a long time. 

We aim to demonstrate a basic working of a vanilla home automation system
where we make a collective sensor box (referred to as Ubermensch box) which acts
as detectors and is consequently connected to various actuators to achieve
automation of day-to-day systems.

Hardware :

 Raspberry Pi-3
 MQ-2 Smoke detection sensor
 HC-SR04-Ultrasonic Range Finder 
 LM393 Sound Detection Sensor
 4 Channel Relay Board
 MCP3008- ADC
 Breadboard
 Jumper Wires
 Buzzer
 Bulb
 LED
 Adapter


Software Requirements

Software :
 Python 3.6
 Various Modules like (time,RPi.GPIO)
 Raspberry OS
